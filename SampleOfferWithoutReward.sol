/*
  An Offer from a Contractor to the DAO without any reward going back to
  the DAO.

  Feel free to use as a template for your own proposal.

  Actors:
  - Offerer:    the entity that creates the Offer. Usually it is the initial
                Contractor.
  - Contractor: the entity that has rights to withdraw money to perform
                its project.
  - Client:     the DAO that gives money to the Contractor. It signs off
                the Offer, can adjust daily withdraw limit or even fire the
                Contractor.
